        "    # Purpose of Constraints in a Database\n",
        "      Constraints in a database are rules or conditions that are applied to\n",
        "      columns in a table to ensure that the data entered adheres to certain rules,\n",
        "      maintaining the integrity and correctness of the data. They help ensure\n",
        "      the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the data stored in the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "    # How Constraints Help Maintain Data Integrity\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Enforcing Validity of Data: Constraints prevent the insertion of invalid\n",
        "     data into the table. For example, a CHECK constraint can ensure that the\n",
        "     values in a column are within a certain range\n",
        "      (e.g., an employee's age must be 18 or older).\n",
        "\n",
        "   2. Ensuring Uniqueness: Some constraints enforce that data within a column\n",
        "      (or combination of columns) is unique, preventing duplicate records.\n",
        "\n",
        "   3. Establishing Relationships: Foreign key constraints ensure that data in\n",
        "      one table corresponds to data in another table, maintaining referential integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "   4. Preventing Null Values: Constraints like NOT NULL ensure that a column\n",
        "      always contains a value, preventing incomplete or missing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "   5. Defining Default Values: A DEFAULT constraint assigns default values to a\n",
        "      column if no value is provided, ensuring that the column is never left\n",
        "      empty unintentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "By applying these constraints, a database can ensure that its data adheres to\n",
        "business rules, reducing the chance of errors, inconsistencies, or incomplete records.\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Common Types of Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "1. PRIMARY KEY:\n",
        "\n",
        "   > Purpose: Uniquely identifies each record in a table. The column(s) defined\n",
        "    as a primary key cannot contain NULL values, and each value must be unique.\n",
        "   > Example:\n",
        "     emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\n",
        "Here, emp_id is the primary key for the employees table.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. FOREIGN KEY:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Purpose: Ensures that the value in a column matches a value in another table\n",
        "    (usually the primary key of the other table), ensuring referential integrity.\n",
        "  > Example:\n",
        "    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)\n",
        "This ensures that any department_id in the employees table corresponds to a\n",
        "       valid department_id in the departments table.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. UNIQUE:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Purpose: Ensures that all values in a column (or combination of columns)\n",
        "    are unique across the table, preventing duplicate entries.\n",
        "  > Example:\n",
        "    email TEXT UNIQUE\n",
        "This ensures that each employee has a unique email.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. NOT NULL:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Purpose: Ensures that a column cannot contain a NULL value. This is useful\n",
        "    for columns where data is required for the record to be meaningful.\n",
        "  > Example:\n",
        "    emp_name TEXT NOT NULL\n",
        "Here, every employee must have a name.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.CHECK:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Purpose: Ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specified condition\n",
        "    or set of conditions.\n",
        "  > Example:\n",
        "    age INTEGER CHECK (age >= 18)\n",
        "This ensures that the employee's age is at least 18.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. DEFAULT:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Purpose: Provides a default value for a column if no value is specified\n",
        "    during the insertion of a record.\n",
        "  > Example:\n",
        "    salary DECIMAL DEFAULT 30000\n",
        "If no salary is specified for an employee, it will default to 30,000.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. INDEX:\n",
        "\n",
        "  > Purpose: Improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. While\n",
        "    not a \"constraint\" in the strictest sense, an index is often used to speed\n",
        "    up searches on columns.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify\n",
        "your answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "     # Why Apply the NOT NULL Constraint to a Column?\n",
        "      The NOT NULL constraint is applied to a column to ensure that every record in\n",
        "      the table has a valid value for that column. In other words, it prevents\n",
        "      the column from having null (empty or missing) values. Here are some\n",
        "       reasons why you might apply this constraint:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Required Data: If the column represents essential data for the record,\n",
        "   such as a name, age, or email address, the NOT NULL constraint ensures that\n",
        "  these fields cannot be left blank. For example, an employee's name or a\n",
        "  product's price may be required for the record to make sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Data Integrity: By disallowing null values, you ensure that every record in\n",
        "  the table is complete and consistent, preventing incomplete or invalid records\n",
        "  that could create problems for data processing or analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Avoiding Errors: Having null values in critical fields could lead to errors\n",
        "  in querying, reporting, or calculations. For instance, if a column holds a\n",
        "  numerical value and is used in calculations, null values would result in\n",
        "  errors or incorrect results.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Business Rules Enforcement: In some cases, business logic may dictate that a\n",
        "   value is mandatory for all records. For instance, you might want to ensure\n",
        "   that every employee has a valid salary, and therefore apply the NOT NULL\n",
        "   constraint to the salary column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
        "    No, a primary key cannot contain null values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  # Justification:\n",
        "\n",
        "       1.Uniqueness: The primary key is used to uniquely identify each row in a\n",
        "       table. If the primary key allowed NULL values, it would violate this\n",
        "       uniqueness rule because NULL is not considered equal to any other value,\n",
        "       including another NULL. Therefore, allowing NULL values in the primary\n",
        "       key would mean that multiple records could share the same null value,\n",
        "       making it impossible to guarantee uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "      2.Entity Integrity: The purpose of a primary key is to ensure that every\n",
        "       row in the table can be uniquely identified by its key value. If a primary\n",
        "       key allowed NULL, you would lose the ability to guarantee that each record\n",
        "       has a unique identifier. This would undermine the integrity of the database,\n",
        "       leading to potential problems in data retrieval, updating, and\n",
        "       referencing other tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "      3.Database Standards: According to database design principles and standards\n",
        "       (such as the relational model), primary keys are required to have a unique\n",
        "       value for each record, and NULL is considered to be an unknown or undefined\n",
        "          value, which does not satisfy the requirement for uniqueness.\n",

        "4.  Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an\n",
        "example for both adding and removing a constraint?\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Removing Constraints from an Existing Table\n",
        "To remove a constraint from an existing table, you use the ALTER TABLE statement\n",

        "# Common Consequences:\n",
        "1. Data Integrity Issues: Violating a constraint can cause the data in the\n",
        "   database to become inconsistent, incorrect, or invalid. For example,\n",
        "   inserting duplicate entries into a column that requires unique values\n",
        "   (e.g., a column with a UNIQUE constraint) can corrupt the data's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Error Generation: The DBMS will generate an error message indicating which\n",
        "   constraint was violated and what caused the violation. This prevents the\n",
        "   operation (insert, update, or delete) from being executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Rollback of Transaction: In most databases, if a constraint violation occurs\n",
        "   during a transaction, the transaction will be rolled back to maintain the\n",
        "   integrity of the data. This ensures that the database is not left in an\n",
        "   inconsistent state.\n",
        "\n",
